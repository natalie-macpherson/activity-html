    <h1>Pop Art</h1>
    
    <p>Pop artists produced works based on the popular images from 1950's culture. They poke fun at the seriousness with which some people regarded these commercial images and icons.</p>

    <h2>Andy Warhol</h2>

    <p><strong>Warhol:</strong> "I wanted something stronger that gave more fo an <strong>assembly line</strong> effect. With <strong>silk screening</strong> you pick a photograph, blow it up, transfer it in glue onto silk, and then roll ink across it so the ink goes through the silk. That way you get the same image, slightly different each time."</p>

    <h2>Jasper Johns</h2>
    
    <p>His canvases were devoted to such familiar objects as targets, American flags. He painted these subjects with objectvity and precision, applying paint very thickly, so that the paintings became objects in themselves rather than reproductions of recognizable items. This idea of <strong>art-as-object</strong> became a potent influence on later sculpture as well as painting.</p>

    <p><strong>Johns:</strong> "I like to repeat an image in another <strong>medium</strong> to observe the play between the two: the image and the <strong>medium</strong>. In a sense, one does the same thing two ways and can observe <strong>differences</strong> and <strong>samenesses</strong>, the stress the image takes in different media."</p>

    <img src="images/Roy_Lichtenstein.jpg" alt="Roy Lichtenstein">
    
    <p>Working with <strong>stencils</strong>, Lichtenstein developed a technique using rows of dots that mimicked the  <strong>commercial printing patters</strong> using in the production of comic books. Lichtenstein sought an anonymous style, removing all personal reference from his work to convey the appearance of <strong>mass production</strong>.</p>
    <p>Lichtenstein once said: "All my art is in some way about other art, even if the other art is cartoons.</p>
